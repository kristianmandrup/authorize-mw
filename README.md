authorize-mw
============

Authorization middleware for Node.js and Javascript platform in general (with a little twist)

## Contribute

Requires Node.s installed on your computer (http://www.node.org)
Also currently requires Coffeescript! (TODO: convert to LiveScript!)

```
$ npm install coffee-script -g
$ npm install
```

Compile coffeescript files!

This can be done either manually or from within an editor using a coffeescript plugin

$ node <target file>

TODO:
Please create tests using mocha or jasmine in /test folder

Cheers!
